        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML is used to create the structure of a webpage. It is made up of elements which work together to provide content and the basic framework for all pages on the web.</li>
          <li>An element is a type of content on a webpage such as: text elements, image elements, header elements, list elements. Elements are also used to divide the content on the page and to describe the content to browsers and other developers. Common element types that are used to divide and describe a page are meta-related elements, content division elements, & semantic elements.</li>
          <li>The !DOCTYPE html declaration tells the browser what document type it should expect when it is opened.</li>
          <li>Metadata is data about our webpage that the browser uses to effectively serve our webpage to users.</li>
          <li>The title element defines the title for a webpage.</li>
          <li>The style element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
          <li>The base element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
          <li>The meta element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport.</li>
          <li>The base element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
          <li>The charset element sets our character encoding.</li>
          <li>The http-equiv element sets an HTTP header for content.</li>
          <li>The viewport element sets the default view for our webpage.</li>
          <li>It is still common to see non-semantic elements such as div to create a division in the page, or span to create an inline division.</li>
          <li>The h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6 elements represent the level of heading a given text block represents.</li>
          <li>The ul, ol, and li elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items.</li>
          <li>The br element creates a line of empty space, or a line break, between two blocks of content.</li>
          <li>The section elements allow us to elegantly organize the content on our page based on the topics we have.</li>
          <li>HTML uses the id attribute as a way to identify elements and select them.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>HTML uses the id and class attributes as a way to identify elements and select them. </li>
          <li> The a element creates links to the same webpage or other webpages.</li>
          <li>The h1 header should only appear once on each page.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS defines the colors, aesthetics, visual layout, and organization. </li>
          <li>Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only.</li>
          <li>Internal Stylesheets are placed directly in a webpage's HTML file using a "style" element in the "head" element.</li>
          <li>The most common way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet.</li>
          <li>A link element in the head of the HTML document creates the connection to an external file.</li>
          <li>A rel attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document resource. An href attribute specifies the location (URL) of the external resource.</li>
          <li>Use the * selector to apply a rule to all the elements visible on the page.</li>
          <li>Combine two selectors into a single CSS rule with a comma.</li>
          <li>The img selector assigns property values to any image element in the markup. </li>
          <li>The display property with the block value assigns each image to start on a new line.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript is the tool that takes a static HTML/CSS webpage and makes it interactive.</li>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>To declare a variable, we use the var keyword. We use an assignment operator = to assign the specific data that we want stored in our variable.</li>
          <li>All strings are surrounded by quotation marks.</li>
          <li>Each line of JavaScript code ends with a semicolon.</li>
          <li>We can use the console.log method to output a message to the web console by adding an argument.</li>
          <li> A JavaScript file is read from top to bottom.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>Control flow can be interrupted by the use of conditional statements and loops to control the order in which code is executed, or if it is even executed at all.</li>
          <li>An if statement is a way of introducing decision-making into our code.</li>
          <li> The strict equality operator (===) checks to see if two values are equal, and returns a Boolean result true if the values are equal and false if the values are not equal.</li>
          <li>To create an array, we declare a variable when we assign the variable to a group of values.</li>
          <li>Arrays are useful tools for storing multiple items with different data types in a single variable, but not all arrays must have multiple data types.</li>
          <li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over by using another statement, such as the conditional if statement, to interrupt the control flow by executing a block of code a specific number of times.</li>
          <li>The code x++ is a shortcut way of writing x=x+1.</li>
          <li>Math.floor() and Math.random() are both properties of JavaScript's built-in Math object that can be used together to generate a random number.</li>
